## Credits

This project has been built with a number of third-party applications, including Heroku, Insomnia, mySQL, Sequelize and Handlebars. It would not be possible without all those that have contributed to these applications. 

The lessons of the University of Sydney coding boot camp have also been invaluable, and have allowed me to go back and check errors in my own code.
